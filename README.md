## Today I learned: Comic Jam + 3D Printing

We're going to use a customizable lithopane model from Thingiverse to print a relief of our comic book jam during a May Today I learned workshop at Oakland's Sudoroom.

All Hail Oakland Downtown Additive Manufacturing and Creativity for the common good and open source community!!!!
