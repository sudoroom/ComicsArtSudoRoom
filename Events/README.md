Roll out a big roll of paper
People draw their characters interacting (1 or more characters per artist)
We scan the drawing
We fuse the scan onto a 3D Model using the customizable Lithopane onThingiverse - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:74322
Print out the lithopane on the 3D Printer
Warning - this might take a while (at least 20-30 minutes?)

[edit] Inspiration

Bread and Puppet Theater I used to volunteer in the Bread & Puppet Theater in NYC. They are like a real-life cartoon come to life, only mixed with theater.
There's going to be a Dance rehearsal at 6pm, so if you want to involve dancing in your comics, that's awesome!
